# Building Chatbot Notebook

In this repository, we will build a simple AI chatbot from scratch using OpenAI's API (which provides powerful language models like GPT-3.5) and Streamlit (a Python library for creating web apps).

By the end, we'll have a beginner-friendly chatbot that runs in our browser, with a chat interface for conversations and a file uploader for sharing files with the bot. 

## What we'll build:

- A web application where you can type messages to an AI agent and receive responses
- The interface will resemble a chat window (like messaging apps)
- An option to upload a file (for example, a text file) that your chatbot could potentially use
